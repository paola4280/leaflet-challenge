Leaflet | working with maps | visualization

The JavaScript code for this challenge is in the folder "js", located in the "static" folder. This is the link to the GitHub Page: 

Leaflet is a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive maps, making it an essential tool for visualizing geospatial data. It supports various features such as customizable markers, popups, layers, and legends. With Leaflet, real-time data can be easily integrated, like earthquake information, and dynamically style map elements based on attributes like magnitude or depth. This ability to enhance user interaction through visually intuitive maps makes Leaflet a great tool in data visualization.

For this challenge, I mostly used class notes to follow the process step by step and for debugging I used ChatGPT. The section I had the most trouble with was adding the legend to the map's markers so I used more AI suggestions for that part.
